# Invoice app

This is a solution to the [Invoice app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl). 
I am working on it, not finished yet.

Users should be able to:

- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
